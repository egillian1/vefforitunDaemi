    <h1>Block versus inline</h1>
    <div class="blockWrapper">
      <p>
        Div element for containing block elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a paragraph with the typical block characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a second paragraph, also with the typical block
        characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every paragraph has its own box model for the element.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="inlineWrapper">
      <p>
        Div element for containing inline elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a paragraph that should have block characteristics, but now
        has inline characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same applies to this second paragraph. It now has inline
        characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every paragraph is collapsed and each one shares its space with the
        adjacent paragraphs.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="inlineBlockWrapper">
      <p>
        Div element for containing inline-block elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a paragraph that combines block characteristics and inline
        characteristics.
      </p>
    </div>
